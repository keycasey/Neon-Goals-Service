# AGENTS.md - Agent Communication Guide

## Repo Instructions

This repository also has a [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) file with core development guidance.

Agents working in this repo should:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` before making code changes.
2. Treat `CLAUDE.md` as the primary repo development guide.
3. Use this `AGENTS.md` for agent-specific communication and API behavior.

## Tooling

- Use `bun` as the default JavaScript/TypeScript package manager and task runner for this project.
- Prefer `bun run <script>` over `npm run <script>` unless a task explicitly requires another tool.
- Keep new repo instructions aligned with `CLAUDE.md` so agent docs do not drift.

This document explains how agents communicate with the Neon Goals Service — both internally (OpenClaw sessions) and externally (via API).

## Internal Communication (OpenClaw)

Agents running within OpenClaw can interact with the Neon Goals Service using the **sessions_send** tool to spawn specialized sub-agents that work with goal data.

### Agent Types

| Agent | Purpose | Entry Point |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Overview Agent** | General goal management, creating goals, prioritization | `POST /ai/overview/chat` |
| **Category Specialist** | Domain-specific assistance (items, finances, actions) | `POST /ai/category/:categoryId/chat` |
| **Goal View Agent** | Deep dive into a specific goal's details and candidates | `POST /ai/goal/:goalId/chat` |

### Spawning a Sub-Agent

When you need AI assistance with goals, spawn a sub-agent with the appropriate context:

```python
# Example: Spawn an agent to help with vehicle search
sessions_spawn(
    task="Help me find a 2023-2024 GMC Sierra 3500HD Denali Ultimate under $100000 within 500 miles of 94002. Use the goal management system.",
    label="neon-vehicle-search",
    mode="session",  # Persistent session for multi-turn conversations
    timeoutSeconds=300
)
```

### Internal Agent Context

OpenClaw agents have access to:
- **User context** (if running in a main session with an authenticated user)
- **API authentication** via stored JWT tokens (from user login)
- **Tool access** to make HTTP requests to the service

#### Reading User Goals (Internal)

```python
# From an OpenClaw agent with user context
import requests

# Get JWT token from environment or session storage
jwt_token = os.getenv('NEON_GOALS_JWT')

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {jwt_token}'
}

# Fetch user goals
response = requests.get('https://goals.keycasey.com/api/goals', headers=headers)
goals = response.json()
```

#### Sending Messages to AI Specialists (Internal)

```python
# Chat with the overview agent
response = requests.post(
    'https://goals.keycasey.com/api/ai/overview/chat',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {jwt_token}'},
    json={'message': 'What should I work on today?'}
)

reply = response.json()['reply']
```

---

## External Communication (HTTP API)

Agents running outside OpenClaw (or in isolated sessions) use **API Key authentication** to communicate with the service.

### Authentication Methods

| Method | Header | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **JWT** | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | User-authenticated requests |
| **API Key** | `X-API-Key: <key>` | Agent-to-agent communication |

### API Key Setup

The service uses a single `AGENT_API_KEY` environment variable for agent authentication. All API key requests share the same generic "agent" identity (`userId: "agent"`).

#### Generating an API Key

```bash
# Generate a secure 32-byte base64 key
openssl rand -base64 32
# Example output: Ce4QAMETH3m1pBf9yt8TCZY6ZkF8KQy0R+JbQH3K3Pk=

# Add to .env
echo "AGENT_API_KEY=Ce4QAMETH3m1pBf9yt8TCZY6ZkF8KQy0R+JbQH3K3Pk=" >> .env
```

#### Making Authenticated Requests

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'X-API-Key': 'Ce4QAMETH3m1pBf9yt8TCZY6ZkF8KQy0R+JbQH3K3Pk=',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

# Get chat structure (agent discovery)
response = requests.get('https://goals.keycasey.com/api/chats', headers=headers)
chats = response.json()

# Send message to overview specialist
response = requests.post(
    'https://goals.keycasey.com/api/ai/overview/chat',
    headers=headers,
    json={'message': 'What are the best practices for goal setting?'}
)

reply = response.json()['reply']
```

### Agent-Scoped Data Access

**Important:** API Key authentication provides a neutral "agent" context:

| Endpoint | JWT Returns | API Key Returns |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `GET /goals` | User's goals | `[]` (empty array) |
| `GET /chats` | User's chat history | Empty structure |
| `GET /chats/overview` | User's overview chat | New agent chat |
| `POST /goals/item` | Creates for user | Creates for agent (userId: "agent") |

**Design Pattern:** Agents use API keys to:
- Chat with AI specialists (expertise without user data)
- Create goals in their own context (for automation workflows)
- Trigger scraping jobs (refresh candidates)

---

## Agent Discovery Protocol

The `/api/chats` endpoint provides a structured view of available specialist agents for automated discovery.

### Chat Structure

```json
{
  "overview": {
    "id": "overview-chat-id",
    "title": "Overview",
    "description": "General goal management assistant",
    "categoryId": null,
    "messages": []
  },
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": "items",
      "title": "Items",
      "description": "Product search and comparison specialist",
      "chat": {
        "id": "items-chat-id",
        "messages": []
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "finances",
      "title": "Finances",
      "description": "Financial planning and tracking specialist",
      "chat": {
        "id": "finances-chat-id",
        "messages": []
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "actions",
      "title": "Actions",
      "description": "Task and project management specialist",
      "chat": {
        "id": "actions-chat-id",
        "messages": []
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Discovering Specialists

```python
# Fetch available specialists
response = requests.get('https://goals.keycasey.com/api/chats', headers=headers)
chats = response.json()

# List all categories
for category in chats['categories']:
    print(f"{category['title']}: {category['description']}")

# Send message to a specific specialist
items_chat_id = chats['categories'][0]['chat']['id']
response = requests.post(
    f'https://goals.keycasey.com/api/chats/{items_chat_id}/messages',
    headers=headers,
    json={'content': 'How do I compare vehicle specs?'}
)
```

## Agent Proposal System

AI agents can propose goal changes through structured commands embedded in their responses.

### Command Format

Commands use a colon-separated prefix with JSON payload:

```
COMMAND_NAME: {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"}
```

### Proposal Types

| Type | Buttons | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| `confirm_edit_cancel` | Confirm, Edit, Cancel | Editable proposals (title, filters, progress) |
| `accept_decline` | Accept, Decline | Binary choices (refresh, archive) |

### Available Commands

| Command | Description | Proposal Type |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `CREATE_GOAL` | Create a new goal | `confirm_edit_cancel` |
| `CREATE_SUBGOAL` | Create a subgoal under existing goal | `confirm_edit_cancel` |
| `UPDATE_TITLE` | Change goal title (updates searchTerm for items) | `confirm_edit_cancel` |
| `UPDATE_FILTERS` | Update vehicle search filters | `confirm_edit_cancel` |
| `UPDATE_PROGRESS` | Update goal completion percentage | `confirm_edit_cancel` |
| `ADD_TASK` | Add task to action goal | `confirm_edit_cancel` |
| `REMOVE_TASK` | Remove task from action goal | `confirm_edit_cancel` |
| `TOGGLE_TASK` | Toggle task completion | `confirm_edit_cancel` |
| `REFRESH_CANDIDATES` | Trigger new scrape for item goal | `accept_decline` |
| `ARCHIVE_GOAL` | Archive a goal | `confirm_edit_cancel` |

### Command Examples

#### Create a Goal

```
CREATE_GOAL: {"type":"item","title":"2023-2024 GMC Sierra 3500HD","budget":100000,"category":"vehicle","searchTerm":"2023-2024 GMC Sierra 3500HD Denali Ultimate black 4WD under $100000","proposalType":"confirm_edit_cancel","awaitingConfirmation":true}
```

#### Refresh Candidates

```
REFRESH_CANDIDATES: {"goalId":"goal-123","proposalType":"accept_decline","awaitingConfirmation":true}
```

#### Update Progress

```
UPDATE_PROGRESS: {"goalId":"goal-123","progress":65,"proposalType":"confirm_edit_cancel","awaitingConfirmation":true}
```

### Executing Commands

```python
# Confirm a proposal
response = requests.post(
    'https://goals.keycasey.com/api/ai/command/confirm',
    headers=headers,
    json={'pendingCommand': 'CREATE_GOAL: {...}'}
)

# Cancel a proposal
response = requests.post(
    'https://goals.keycasey.com/api/ai/command/cancel',
    headers=headers,
    json={'pendingCommand': 'CREATE_GOAL: {...}'}
)

# Edit a proposal (returns current values for editing)
response = requests.post(
    'https://goals.keycasey.com/api/ai/command/edit',
    headers=headers,
    json={'pendingCommand': 'CREATE_GOAL: {...}'}
)
edited_fields = response.json()
```

## Agent Redirect System

Agents can hand the user off to a better chat context by embedding redirect commands in their response text.

### Redirect Commands

Redirect commands use the same `COMMAND_NAME: {json}` format:

```
REDIRECT_TO_CATEGORY: {"categoryId":"items","message":"The Items specialist can help compare these listings."}
REDIRECT_TO_GOAL: {"goalId":"goal-123","goalTitle":"GMC Sierra 3500HD","message":"Let’s switch to the goal view for this truck."}
REDIRECT_TO_OVERVIEW: {"message":"This is broader than one goal, so Overview is the best place to continue."}
```

### Redirect Payload Rules

- `REDIRECT_TO_CATEGORY` requires `categoryId` (`items`, `finances`, or `actions`)
- `REDIRECT_TO_GOAL` requires `goalId`; `goalTitle` is optional but recommended for UI labels
- `REDIRECT_TO_OVERVIEW` needs only a user-facing `message`
- `message` should be short and written for the user because the frontend shows it in the redirect card

### Context Preservation

When the backend executes a redirect command, it prepares the target chat by:

- Getting or creating the destination chat
- Copying the last several visible user/assistant messages from the source chat
- Writing a hidden system handoff message into the destination chat
- Including the redirect reason/message in that handoff
- Recording recent thread IDs in message metadata for traceability

This lets the destination agent pick up with the recent context already attached, while the frontend handles the actual navigation when the user clicks Go.

## Best Practices

### Internal (OpenClaw) Agents

1. **Use JWT authentication** when user context is available
2. **Spawn sub-agents** for specialized tasks (e.g., vehicle search)
3. **Respect user data boundaries** — don't share data across sessions
4. **Use streaming responses** for long-running AI tasks (`/chat/stream` endpoints)

### External Agents

1. **Use API Key authentication** for agent-to-agent communication
2. **Expect neutral data context** — API keys return empty/agent-specific data
3. **Leverage specialist agents** for domain expertise without needing user data
4. **Handle proposals asynchronously** — agents can suggest changes, user confirms later

### Agent Discovery

1. **Query `/api/chats`** to discover available specialists
2. **Check chat history** to avoid repeating conversations
3. **Use category-specific endpoints** for focused assistance (`/api/category/:categoryId/chat`)

### Error Handling

```python
# Handle authentication errors
if response.status_code == 401:
    if 'Invalid API key' in response.json()['message']:
        # Check AGENT_API_KEY configuration
        pass
    elif 'Invalid or expired JWT token' in response.json()['message']:
        # Re-authenticate user
        pass

# Handle proposal errors
if response.status_code == 400:
    error = response.json()
    if 'pendingCommand' in error:
        # Another command is already pending
        pass
```

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Agent-Assisted Vehicle Search (Internal)

```python
# 1. Get user's goals
goals_response = requests.get('/api/goals', headers=jwt_headers)
goals = goals_response.json()

# 2. Spawn a specialist to help with vehicle search
sessions_spawn(
    task="Review the user's vehicle goals and suggest improvements. "
         "Use the goal management system to create or update goals.",
    label="vehicle-specialist"
)

# 3. Specialist discovers vehicle goal and proposes filters
# Agent sends: "I found your GMC Sierra goal. Want me to refine the search?"
# With command: UPDATE_FILTERS: {...}

# 4. User confirms
requests.post('/api/ai/command/confirm', headers=jwt_headers, json={...})

# 5. Trigger refresh
requests.post(f'/api/goals/{goal_id}/candidates/refresh', headers=jwt_headers)
```

### Workflow 2: External Automation Agent

```python
# 1. Agent discovers overview specialist
chats = requests.get('/api/chats', headers=api_key_headers).json()
overview_chat_id = chats['overview']['id']

# 2. Agent asks for goal-setting best practices
response = requests.post(
    f'/api/chats/{overview_chat_id}/messages',
    headers=api_key_headers,
    json={'content': 'What are the SMART goal criteria?'}
)

# 3. Agent uses advice to create structured content
# (No user data needed — pure AI expertise)
```

### Workflow 3: Webhook Integration

```python
# External service triggers goal creation via webhook
def handle_webhook(event):
    # Create goal in agent context
    response = requests.post(
        'https://goals.keycasey.com/api/goals/item',
        headers={'X-API-Key': AGENT_API_KEY, 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
        json={
            'title': event['item_name'],
            'category': 'product',
            'searchTerm': f"{event['item_name']} under {event['budget']}"
        }
    )
    return response.json()
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key"
- Verify `AGENT_API_KEY` is set in service's `.env`
- Ensure header name is `X-API-Key` (not `Authorization`)
- Restart service after changing `.env`

### Empty Chat History
- Expected behavior for API Key authentication
- Agents start fresh conversations each time

### Proposal Buttons Not Appearing
- Check `proposalType` is included in command JSON
- Verify `awaitingConfirmation: true` is set
- Ensure frontend is polling for pending proposals

### 403 Forbidden on Goal Access
- API keys cannot access user-specific goals
- Use JWT authentication for user data
- Create agent-scoped goals with API key (userId: "agent")
